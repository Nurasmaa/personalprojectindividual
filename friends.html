<p> The first photo is my friends from six years old until now, 23 years old. Two of my friend is already married and two other is still single. That photo was taken at my best friend wedding. Her name is Sulaemyra binti Sulaiman and she already married for two years. Norasikin binti Rosli is also married after six month from the first one married. My previous friend is Nur Ain Nabila binti Mahadi. She is still single and now she work at TNB Klang. I love them soo much because they know and accept who i am.</p>

<p> The second photo is my friends that i meet at University Kota Bharu. The person in that photo is Nur Izzati Adilah binti Zaidi, Nik Nor Aida Hanim binti Amran and the last one is Nur Izzati binti Anuar. Two of them lived in Kelantan and another one lived in Selangor. Although i know them only for two years, they treat me well and always be there for me if i have problem. They like a sisters to me and hope we will continue this relationship after finish study. 
</p>

<p>Person in that photo is really meaningful to me because they like my family to me. They are Nur Aqilah binti Zakaria, Siti Rafizah binti Rashid and the last one is Sarah Mustika binti Zainal Arifin. I know them when i continue my study in UITM Jengka. They treat me well everytime and have take care of me when i fall in sick. They teach me about how to life without family at there. They give me support everytime i do things. Alhamdulillah they still have a good relationship with me until now.</p>
